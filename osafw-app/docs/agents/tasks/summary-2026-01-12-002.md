## What changed
- replaced list table wrappers to use the new fw-list-card class and added styling overrides so default theme stays flat while theme20/theme30 keep card-like list panes.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- not run (not requested).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- none.

## Decisions - why
- kept fw-list-card visually flat in site.css and reintroduced card styling in theme20/theme30 to match requested theme behavior.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- none.
