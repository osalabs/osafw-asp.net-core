## What changed
- Addressed feedback on page header rollout: renamed hide flag to `is_hide_page_header_actions_std`, moved its population into controllers, restored lookups index to original header, and provided dedicated attachment header actions include.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- (none – toolchain unavailable)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet` CLI not available in container, so tests could not be executed.

## Decisions - why
- Controllers set `is_hide_page_header_actions_std` to follow ParsePage guidance while keeping templates declarative.
- Lookups index keeps its bespoke header per feedback; attachment header actions now live in a subtemplate consumed by shared page header.
- New summary recorded separately per instructions.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Pass view flags from controllers instead of setting them inline in templates when ParsePage variables are required.
