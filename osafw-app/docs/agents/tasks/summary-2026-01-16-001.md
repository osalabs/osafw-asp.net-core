## What changed
- Added a standard modal component that loads remote content, executes inline scripts, and wires modal forms to ajaxForm submissions.
- Added a fw.js helper to resolve the trigger element for modal scripts.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Ensured modal-trigger lookup works by tagging both the trigger element and modal with a shared id.

## Decisions - why
- Implemented modal content loading with a manual script-execution pass so inline modal scripts can run in context.
- Used ajaxForm for modal forms to reload HTML responses directly into the modal.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
