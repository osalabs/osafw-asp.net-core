## What changed
- Added Vue form tab payloads in `FwVueController`, including tab-specific field mappings and tab-aware field collection for item payloads and lookups.
- Extended the Vue store with form tab state, tab-aware getters, and URL syncing for tab navigation.
- Updated Vue view/edit templates to render tab navigation and use tab-aware field trees.
- Rearranged AdminDemosVue and AdminDemosDynamic configs into four form tabs with tab-specific layouts, using empty tab code for the default/main tab and removing duplicate full-field lists.
- Logged a new heuristic about syncing Vue tabs with URL query params.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (not requested).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet` is not available in the environment (needed to run the app for screenshots).

## Decisions - why
- Implemented client-side tab switching with URL updates to match dynamic tab UX without requiring server-side reloads.
- Kept tab support optional by falling back to existing field lists when tabs are absent.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer syncing Vue tab state with URL query params to keep deep links stable.
