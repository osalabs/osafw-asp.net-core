## What changed
- Refactored list filter toolbars: dynamic lists now use a combined export + search/custom/density/print toolbar inline with filters; static lists get a simpler print + density toolbar inline with their filters.
- Updated list filter partials across admin and my screens to use the appropriate toolbar variants and reverted export/status helpers to focus on their original responsibilities.
- Adjusted attachment/settings/custom list filters to embed toolbar controls within the existing filter rows.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (template and JS changes only).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Ensured density toggle finds the target table when triggered from the filter toolbar (handled previously and retained).

## Decisions - why
- Split dynamic vs static toolbars to match available functionality (custom columns/search toggles only where supported) and keep layout consistent with Vue screens.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- None.
