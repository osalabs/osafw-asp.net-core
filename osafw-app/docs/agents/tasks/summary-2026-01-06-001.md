## What changed
- Added optional compact list header templates (page header + combined filter/action row) with shared hidden filter field include, including `is_search`.
- Refined standard list/form add-new buttons to expose label spans for responsive text hiding.
- Updated compact filter markup/styling for full-size controls, simpler includes, and improved wrapping of selects/actions on mid-size screens.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- _Not run (template/CSS-only changes)._

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Needed a shared partial for list filter hidden fields (including `is_search`) to avoid duplication between standard and compact layouts.
- Adjusted responsive rules (min widths, breakpoint overrides) so selects and table actions share rows cleanly before falling back to stacked layout.

## Decisions - why
- Created a dedicated compact filter template to keep the standard layout intact and let controllers opt in by swapping includes.
- Scoped text-hiding to `.list-filter-compact` via `.btn-label` spans to preserve readability on full-size layouts while keeping full-size controls.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer small shared partials (e.g., hidden filter inputs) when introducing alternative layouts to reduce drift.
