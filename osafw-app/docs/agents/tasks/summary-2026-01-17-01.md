## What changed
- Added an echarts include component, switched dashboard charts to echarts, and added mini bar charts for last-login activity on the Admin Users list.
- Reworked the Admin Users view layout to mirror the edit screen layout and expose roles/avatar data for view-only display.
- Added list data enrichment for last 7-day login activity in the Admin Users controller and wired the new list column configuration.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (not requested).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- None.

## Decisions - why
- Used a shared echarts helper to keep dashboard charts and list spark bars consistent and avoid repeating resize logic.
- Populated last-login series server-side to keep list rendering simple and avoid N+1 queries.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- None.
