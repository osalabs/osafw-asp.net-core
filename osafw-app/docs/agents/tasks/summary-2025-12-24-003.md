## What changed
- Added per-screen `page_header_actions` and `page_header_actions_right` includes to supply appropriate default buttons (std/edit/view/delete/save) for list, view, and edit headers without controller flags.
- Restored shared page headers' extra-action regions and kept delete/save controls in shared templates per feedback.
- Moved Admin Attachments quick upload into header actions and Manage Categories into extra actions.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- (none – toolchain unavailable)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet` CLI missing in the environment; tests could not be executed.

## Decisions - why
- Use template-level includes to control header buttons per screen while preserving shared header structure and required default controls (delete/save in shared sections).
- Follow feedback to place screen-specific items (quick upload, manage categories) into appropriate action slots.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer per-screen `page_header_actions(_right)` includes to express header button needs instead of template flags or controller variables.
