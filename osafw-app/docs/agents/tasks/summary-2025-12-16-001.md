## What changed
- Simplified `FwConfig` to store a single per-host settings bucket cached on first use, removing per-request copies while keeping concurrent safety.
- Added helper accessors and updated call sites/tests to rely on the host-scoped settings with precomputed route prefix regex values.
- Refreshed tests to initialize host-specific configs via `FwConfig.init` and adjusted task documentation.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `/root/dotnet/dotnet build /p:LibraryRestore=false`

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Needed to refresh unit tests that referenced the removed `FwConfig.settings` static to use the new host-scoped initialization approach.

## Decisions - why
- Per-host settings are immutable after first creation, so caching once per host avoids contention and eliminates per-request mutation costs.
- Precomputing derived values during host initialization reduces runtime overhead and keeps shared dictionaries stable.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Cache host settings once; avoid per-request overrides when inputs are stable.
- For tests, use unique host keys to isolate cached settings between cases.
