## What changed
- Added configurable database timezone (`timezone_db`) surfaced via `DateUtils.DATABASE_TZ`, documented it, and wired defaults through `FwConfig`/`appsettings`.
- Normalized Vue CRUD responses so Added/Updated timestamps honor per-user formats/timezones.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- (none – dotnet CLI missing in container)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet test` is unavailable because the container lacks the `dotnet` executable, so no automated build/test validation could run.

## Decisions - why
- Cached the database timezone inside `DateUtils` to provide a safe fallback before `FwConfig` initializes while still honoring config overrides per environment.
- Added formatting hooks directly to `FwVueController` to keep JSON responses consistent without duplicating logic across individual controllers.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Always run list/detail rows through `fw.formatUserDateTime` before returning JSON if ParsePage templating is bypassed.
