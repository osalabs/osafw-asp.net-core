## What changed
- Reverted app and test projects to target `net10.0` per review feedback.
- Installed the available .NET 8 SDK locally (no .NET 10 SDK available via dotnet-install channels).

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `./dotnet-install.sh --version 8.0.100 --install-dir $HOME/.dotnet`
- `dotnet build osafw-asp.net-core.sln -v:q` (fails: NETSDK1045 because no .NET 10 SDK is available)
- `dotnet test osafw-asp.net-core.sln -v:q` (not run after build failure)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- .NET 10 SDK is not available from `dotnet-install` channels, so builds targeting `net10.0` fail with NETSDK1045 despite installing the .NET 8 SDK.
- LibMan CDN restores are blocked in this environment; set `LibraryRestore=false` during build/test to bypass client asset downloads.
- Many legacy tests depend on SQL Server or unimplemented helpers and currently fail with connection errors or `NotImplementedException`.

## Decisions - why
- Target frameworks returned to `net10.0` to comply with review feedback even though the required SDK is unavailable in this environment.
- Installing .NET 8 SDK at least enables CLI availability for diagnostics while awaiting a .NET 10 SDK source.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- When reading single values with `readValue`, rely on the reader’s `GetDataTypeName` to decide whether timezone conversion should apply.
