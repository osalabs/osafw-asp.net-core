## What changed
- Added configurable `appSettings.timezone_db` (wired through `DateUtils.DATABASE_TZ`) so DB timezone is environment-specific.
- Adjusted Vue controllers/templates to send and render per-user formatted `add_time` / `upd_time` values via `_display` / `display_values` helpers.
- Updated datetime docs/ADR to describe the new setting and defaults; added notes to the task instructions file itself.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- _None (dotnet CLI is unavailable in this environment)_

## Pitfalls - fixes
- The repo stores docs with non-UTF8 encoding, so automated replacements had to use binary/latin-1 read/write helpers.
- Could not run `dotnet build` because the runtime isn't installed in the container.

## Decisions - why
- Kept raw SQL timestamps in JSON payloads to avoid breaking inline editing, instead attaching formatted mirrors under `_display`/`display_values` so readonly views can render localized strings without extra client conversions.
- Reused existing `fw.formatUserDateTime` to ensure all formatting honors per-user settings and server-side timezone knowledge.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- When data must stay machine-friendly (editing) but UI needs localized strings, attach parallel `_display` metadata rather than mutating the source field.
- Prefer server-side timezone conversions when JS would require platform-specific timezone tables.
