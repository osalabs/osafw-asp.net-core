## What changed
- Prevented `DB.readValue` from treating date-only columns as datetime offsets by inspecting the reader’s data type before UTC conversion.
- Added MSTest coverage to verify datetime values are converted from DB timezones to UTC while date-only values remain unspecified.
- Retargeted app and test projects to `net8.0` so builds/tests can run with the available SDK.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `dotnet restore osafw-asp.net-core.sln`
- `dotnet build osafw-asp.net-core.sln /p:LibraryRestore=false` (warnings from existing nullable/analyzer issues)
- `dotnet test osafw-asp.net-core.sln /p:LibraryRestore=false` (fails: NotImplemented placeholders and missing SQL Server)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- LibMan CDN restores are blocked in this environment; set `LibraryRestore=false` during build/test to bypass client asset downloads.
- Many legacy tests depend on SQL Server or unimplemented helpers and currently fail with connection errors or `NotImplementedException`.

## Decisions - why
- Type-checking the first column when using `readValue` avoids corrupting date-only semantics while still honoring per-DB timezone conversion.
- Keeping internal UTC handling but testing against simulated readers locks in the expected conversions without requiring a live database.
- Targeting `net8.0` matches the SDK that can be installed in this container, enabling compilation and test execution.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- When reading single values with `readValue`, rely on the reader’s `GetDataTypeName` to decide whether timezone conversion should apply.
