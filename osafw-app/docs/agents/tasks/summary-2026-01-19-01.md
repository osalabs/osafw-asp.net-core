## What changed
- Updated list screen status filters to use Select2 multi-select with multi-value selection support.
- Added backend parsing for multi-value status filters and updated status filtering logic to honor multi-selects and reset to default on "- all -".
- Adjusted status filter SQL to always use IN() and ensured multi-selects render as single-line controls with theme-aware Select2 styling.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- None.

## Pitfalls - fixes
- None.

## Decisions - why
- Added a shared status parsing helper in `FwController` to support multi-select status filters consistently across list screens.
- Loaded Select2 assets via the standard list filter form fields so list screens get the component without per-template duplication.
- Applied theme variables to Select2 styling to keep compatibility with existing UI themes.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- None.
