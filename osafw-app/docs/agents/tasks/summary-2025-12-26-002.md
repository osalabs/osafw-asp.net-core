## What changed
- Moved list action buttons from table headers into filter forms and added a Print control alongside search/customize/density toggles.
- Updated shared filter partials and list JavaScript so the toolbar works from the filter area across dynamic list screens.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (UI/template-only changes).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Density toggle now locates the table and XSS token even when the control is outside the table wrapper.

## Decisions - why
- Align dynamic list layout with Vue screens by keeping table-related actions with filter controls above the grid.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- None.
