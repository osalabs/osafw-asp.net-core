## What changed
- Continued nullable warning cleanup: hardened AdminRoles ShowAction fallback logic and tightened null checks in dynamic controller autocomplete/attachments handling.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `~/dotnet/dotnet build`

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Build still reports many nullable warnings across FW, Utils, EntityBuilder, etc.; additional iterations required.

## Decisions - why
- Prioritized starting with controller-level warning cleanup; remaining framework warnings need more time.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer providing non-null fallbacks (e.g., empty hashtables/strings) when nullable analysis flags potential nulls.
