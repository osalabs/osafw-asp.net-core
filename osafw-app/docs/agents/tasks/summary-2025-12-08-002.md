## What changed
- Started addressing nullable warnings after upgrading to .NET 10; initial adjustments began in AdminRoles controller.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `dotnet build`

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Build currently reports many nullable warnings that still require resolution.

## Decisions - why
- Prioritized starting with controller-level warning cleanup; remaining framework warnings need more time.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer providing non-null fallbacks (e.g., empty hashtables/strings) when nullable analysis flags potential nulls.
