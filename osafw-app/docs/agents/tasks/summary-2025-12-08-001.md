## What changed
- Re-encoded `docs/dynamic.md` to UTF-8 and reorganized it with type-specific sections, examples, and a navigable reference for dynamic controllers.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- *(not run; documentation-only change)*

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `docs/dynamic.md` contained Windows-1252 characters; decoding with `windows-1252` then rewriting with UTF-8 resolved `UnicodeDecodeError` during editing.

## Decisions - why
- Added per-type sections and examples to make dynamic controller configuration faster to reference while keeping all original option coverage.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Normalize markdown files to UTF-8 before large edits to avoid patch failures.
