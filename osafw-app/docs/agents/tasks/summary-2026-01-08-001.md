## What changed
- restored Vue autocomplete initialization with a guard to prevent double wrapping
- kept Vue autocomplete select/enter handling with cleanup on unmount

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- not run (not requested)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- none

## Decisions - why
- Vue renders inputs after page load, so explicit initialization is required

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- none
