## What changed
- Updated Vue list/view/edit headers to use shared `.page-header` layout and slots, matching non-Vue templates and site.css styling.
- Kept action groups, record navigation, and status indicators within new page-header rows for consistent alignment across screens.
- Adjusted Vue breadcrumbs/prev-next styling to mirror non-Vue headers and ensured Add New/Edit buttons trigger navigation correctly.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- (not run)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- None observed; changes are template/layout only.

## Decisions - why
- Mirrored new shared page header structure so Vue screens align visually and structurally with non-Vue pages while preserving existing functionality.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- When aligning Vue templates to shared markup, mirror structural rows (nav, title, actions) first, then reinsert controls into matching slots.
