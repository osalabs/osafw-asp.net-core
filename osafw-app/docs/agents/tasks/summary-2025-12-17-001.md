## What changed
- Documented every Dynamic/Vue field type with options and dual JSON samples in `docs/dynamic.md`.
- Recorded template/code nuances for complex types (multicb, subtable, attachments).

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (documentation-only change).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Multi-priority fields have no default Show template mapping; noted the limitation instead of promising behaviour.
- Ensured multicb examples use either `lookup_model` or `model`, avoiding the previously mixed example.

## Decisions - why
- Added “common” and “full” samples per type to surface frequent defaults and advanced parameters side by side.
- Included template-derived options so config.json docs match actual rendering and processing paths.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- When documenting dynamic types, read both controller processing and the matching template to confirm supported options.
