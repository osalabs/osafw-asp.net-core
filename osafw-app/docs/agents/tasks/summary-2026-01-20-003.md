## What changed
- Updated status badge color mappings and badge markup to use Bootstrap `text-bg-*` classes, including Active status switching to `text-bg-success`.
- Adjusted fwupdates status lookup configuration and badge defaults to align with the new `text-bg-*` classes.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (not requested).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet` not available in the environment when attempting to run the app.

## Decisions - why
- Applied `text-bg-*` to badge-related classes to align with Bootstrap 5 badge styling and the request to replace `bg-*` where relevant.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer `text-bg-*` for badges instead of `bg-*`.
