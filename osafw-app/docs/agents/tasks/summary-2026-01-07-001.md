## What changed
- added clipboard image intake plus preview/annotation modal with drawing tools, undo, and upload flow for attachment selection.
- documented a canvas-based annotation heuristic.
- updated preview modal string building to avoid template literals.
- ensured preview canvas renders after modal display and text input overlays are visible.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- not run (not requested).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- none.

## Decisions - why
- used a canvas-based annotation flow with scaled export so stroke widths stay visually consistent while preview scales.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- use canvas overlays for quick annotation when no existing component is available.
