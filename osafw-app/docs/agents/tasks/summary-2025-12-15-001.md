## What changed
- Added a reusable helper to reuse cached user view selections during list rendering and avoid duplicate lookups per request.
- Introduced application-level caching (with request-level mirroring) for UserViews defaults and select lists, plus cache invalidation via the standard model cache hooks.
- Kept controller config caching as before (pristine clone removed) per review and documented the helper usage.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- /root/dotnet/dotnet build /p:LibraryRestore=false
- /root/dotnet/dotnet run --project osafw-app.csproj --urls http://0.0.0.0:5000 --no-build
- curl -s -D /tmp/osafw_home_headers.txt http://localhost:5000/ > /tmp/osafw_home.html

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Running the app without SQL Server triggers DistributedSession connection errors; requests still return HTML but logs are noisy.
- Using `dotnet` from PATH fails; `/root/dotnet/dotnet` must be used in this environment.

## Decisions - why
- Cache UserViews defaults and select lists in shared memory (5-minute TTL) and mirror them into the request cache to cut repeated queries for frequent list/show flows while keeping user-specific invalidation on updates.
- Reuse `list_user_view` retrieval to avoid redundant DB calls when preparing list headers and search metadata.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Clone cached hashes/lists before returning to avoid accidental mutations of shared cache entries.
