## What changed
- Added shared page header partials for list and form pages plus breadcrumbs helper; wired Admin/DemosDynamic list/view/edit templates to use the new structure and moved flash messages under the header.
- Added per-screen header content templates (titles, count badge, navigation, actions, save status) and updated styling tokens in `site.css` for the new layout classes.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `dotnet test` *(fails: dotnet command not available in environment)*

## Pitfalls - fixes
- dotnet SDK is absent in the environment, so automated tests could not be executed.

## Decisions - why
- Kept page header markup consistent across list/view/edit by using dedicated common partials with per-screen subtemplates, avoiding controller changes and limiting scope to DemosDynamic.
- Hid existing saved-status markup inside action buttons via CSS while surfacing the status in the header meta row to meet the new layout without altering shared button partial behavior.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer per-screen subtemplates to feed shared layout shells when controller data should remain unchanged.
