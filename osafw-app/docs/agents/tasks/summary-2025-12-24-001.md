## What changed
- Simplified shared page header partials for list and form pages (with built-in title, badges, default buttons, breadcrumbs, and saved-status meta) and kept extension slots for customization.
- Updated Admin/DemosDynamic list/view/edit templates to rely on the shared defaults (only record-nav and save buttons override where needed); refined page-header styling with renamed row classes and compatibility notes.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `dotnet test` *(fails: dotnet command not available in environment)*

## Pitfalls - fixes
- dotnet SDK is absent in the environment, so automated tests could not be executed.

## Decisions - why
- Kept page header markup consistent across list/view/edit by using shared defaults and minimal overrides, avoiding controller changes and limiting scope to DemosDynamic.
- Hid legacy saved-status markup inside action buttons via CSS while surfacing the status in the header meta row to meet the new layout without altering shared button partial behavior.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer per-screen subtemplates to feed shared layout shells when controller data should remain unchanged.
