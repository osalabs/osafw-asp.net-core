## What changed
- Adopted shared page headers across list, view, and edit templates (admin and my areas), removing redundant local button overrides and aligning spacing.
- Simplified Static Pages edit layout and centralized custom actions via page header slots.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- (none – toolchain unavailable)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet test` unavailable in container (`dotnet` missing); unable to run automated tests.

## Decisions - why
- Hid default header actions where screens should not expose “Add New” or similar controls (e.g., Settings, Send Email, personal settings/password/MFA, user-defined views/filters).
- Removed redundant `btn_std_more` overrides once page headers supplied built-in edit/delete/view controls.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Use page_header_* templates and supply `page_header_hide_std_actions` when standard add/view/edit buttons are not appropriate.
