## What changed
- Refactored list filter templates so Export/Print actions render beside search controls while table buttons remain on the second row.
- Removed Print from table button partials (including static) and added dedicated list_filter_actions includes per list to place actions in the new position.
- Updated list_filter_more rows to use the new table button wrappers and maintain consistent layout across dynamic and static screens.
- Adjusted Vue list filter toolbar layout to match the server-rendered templates (actions next to search, table buttons on the second row).
- Renamed the status + table buttons partial and added a list_filter_std_status_more slot for extra per-screen controls.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (template/layout-only changes).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- None encountered.

## Decisions - why
- Separated actions from table controls to let developers inject custom buttons between search and Export/Print while keeping column/density controls grouped on their own row.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer shared wrapper partials for common button toolbars to avoid duplicated layout markup.
