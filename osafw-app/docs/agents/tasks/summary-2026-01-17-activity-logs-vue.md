## What changed
- Added Vue ShowAction payloads for activity logs/userlists and updated the Vue activity logs component to mirror dynamic activity UI.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (not requested).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- None.

## Decisions - why
- Reused Vue ShowAction payload shape from dynamic controller so the same activity data contract can drive the new Vue UI.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- None.
