## What changed
- Removed the bespoke att select modal include in favor of loading the shared modal component.
- Updated attachment selection triggers and modal logic to use standard fw modal flows.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (not requested).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Ensured category refresh works with optional base-url fallback to trigger data-url.

## Decisions - why
- Moved attachment selection handling into the modal onload script to avoid extra trigger wiring.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer fw.modalTriggerEl + scopeFromScript when wiring modal-specific JS.
