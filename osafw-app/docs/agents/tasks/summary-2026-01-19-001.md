## What changed
- Added last-login activity aggregation for admin users list to power a 7-day mini bar chart column, now using model table names in SQL.
- Added the "Last Logins" list column templates, chart initialization script, and new ECharts include component.
- Refactored the dashboard to use the shared ECharts include.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- 

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Swapped hardcoded log table names for model-provided table names.
- Removed redundant conditional wrapper in the last-login column template.

## Decisions - why
- Used a single aggregated query to collect login counts for visible users to avoid per-row queries.
- Rendered mini charts with ECharts to align with the existing dashboard charting approach.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
