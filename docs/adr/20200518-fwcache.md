# ADR 003: FwCache Layer

* **Status** | Accepted

## Context
To improve performance we needed a simple caching mechanism for settings and database lookups. Using external caching solutions would add dependencies.

## Decision
`FwCache` provides an in-memory cache with expiration support. It stores configuration values and other frequently used data inside the application.

## Consequences
The approach keeps the framework self-contained and easy to deploy but may not scale across multiple servers without additional distributed cache configuration.

## Alternatives Considered (optional)
- ASP.NET Core distributed cache: postponed until scaling needs arise.
