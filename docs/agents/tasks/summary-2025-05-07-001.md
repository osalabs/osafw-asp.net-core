## What changed
- Converted legacy VB-style comment snippets to idiomatic C# equivalents across controllers, framework helpers, and models.
- Clarified sample code comments for cache initialization, timing logs, self-tests, and transfer utilities.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- (none run)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- None encountered.

## Decisions - why
- Used `var` declarations and existing method names to align rewritten comments with current C# patterns while retaining contextual guidance.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- When modernizing commented code, mirror surrounding naming conventions and method calls to keep examples relevant.
