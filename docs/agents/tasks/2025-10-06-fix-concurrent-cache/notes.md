# Task Notes — fix-concurrent-cache Concurrency cache compliance

## Summary
* Objective: Ensure static caches use thread-safe collections and comply with agent documentation workflow requirements.
* Affected areas: `osafw-app/App_Code/fw/DB.cs`, `osafw-app/App_Code/fw/ParsePage.cs`, `docs/agents/*`.

## Environment used
* OS/Shell: Linux 6.12.13 / /bin/bash
* Tool versions: dotnet (not installed), node (n/a), python (3.12.10)

## Commands that worked
* build: _not run_
* test: `dotnet test osafw-asp.net-core.sln` *(fails: dotnet not installed in container)*
* run: _not run_

## Pitfalls & fixes
* Symptom → Root cause → Fix
* Concurrent access exceptions → static dictionaries mutated lazily → replace with `ConcurrentDictionary` and `GetOrAdd` usage plus per-connection buckets.

## Decisions & rationale
* Choice → Alternatives → Why
* Use `ConcurrentDictionary` wrappers around schema caches → Locking or lazy init → Concurrent dictionary aligns with multi-threaded requests without broad locks.

## Candidates to promote
* (link to discoveries.json entries)

## Autonomy & budgets
* Tools used: bash, git
* Budgets used: time=limited, tokens=n/a, cost=$0
* Escalation events (if any): none

## Approach selection (general vs specialized)
* Candidates considered → chosen (why)
* General thread-safe cache pattern → chosen for scalability; no specialized alternatives needed.
* Waiver (if any): none

## Editions & freshness
* Model/tool editions pinned: GPT-4 class model via instructions
* Valid-until window for any evidence/benchmarks: n/a

## Reflection Summary (post-task)
* Promotions: Added concurrency heuristic to docs.
* Deferred: End-to-end tests pending due to missing dotnet SDK in container.
* Assumptions: Container lacks dotnet tooling; caches may share read-only mutable state safely.
