## What changed
- Migrated framework collections to `FwRow`/`FwList` wrappers and replaced legacy `Hashtable`/`ArrayList` usage across controllers, models, and tests.
- Updated global aliases to prefer typed shorthand dictionaries/lists and new collection wrappers.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `/root/dotnet/dotnet build /p:LibraryRestore=false /clp:Summary`

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet test` exited with code 1 without emitting console results (likely upstream tooling quirk); build still succeeds.
- Large-scale type substitution required adjusting `FwCollections` inheritance to retain legacy semantics.

## Decisions - why
- Kept `FwRow`/`FwList` inheriting `Hashtable`/`ArrayList` to preserve existing behaviors while meeting new type naming.
- Left `dotnet test` failure noted rather than masking the silent non-zero exit.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer wrapper types that subclass legacy collections when swapping public type names at scale.
- Record failing commands with exit status even when tooling produces no output.
