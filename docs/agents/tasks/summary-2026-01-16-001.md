## What changed
- Updated `fw.initComponent` to accept `assetsUrls` and inline `init` while keeping loader logic generic.
- Moved component asset lists into templates via `assetsUrls` and kept component initialization in template-level `init` functions.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (not requested).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Adjusted loader to infer css vs js from asset urls to simplify component config.

## Decisions - why
- Keep component logic in templates to avoid touching `fw.js` for new components.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Provide asset URLs directly; let loader infer css/js and run scoped init.
