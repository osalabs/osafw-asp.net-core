## What changed
- adjusted ECharts doughnut configuration to control label/legend visibility per theme and added rounded corners for default/theme30
- removed unused dashboard theme overrides and their includes from the dashboard head template

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- 

## Pitfalls - fixes
- dotnet CLI is not available in the environment, so the dashboard could not be run for a screenshot

## Decisions - why
- kept doughnut label/legend toggles in the shared config to align theme-specific behavior in one place

## Heuristics (keep terse)
-
