## What changed
- swapped dashboard charting assets from Chart.js to Apache ECharts and rebuilt the dashboard chart templates/theme logic
- refreshed dashboard chart styling/configuration and updated chart container styles
- updated dashboard documentation to reference Apache ECharts

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- 

## Pitfalls - fixes
- dotnet CLI is not available in the environment, so the dashboard could not be run for a screenshot

## Decisions - why
- moved dashboard chart configuration into a shared ECharts config helper so each panel template can reuse consistent theme styling

## Heuristics (keep terse)
-
