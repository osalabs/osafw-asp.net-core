## What changed
- Added theme-friendly component tokens for cards, page layout spacing, file drop areas, badges, and dashboard cards, aligning defaults with existing styles across base, theme20, and theme30 stylesheets.
- Replaced hardcoded values in shared CSS (drop area radius/color, secondary badge color, multi-value field height) with reusable variables and applied them to card/page/dashboard helpers.
- Shifted theme20 and theme30 overrides to variable values instead of duplicating component styling to keep appearances stable while enabling theme-specific tokens.
- Adjusted file drop padding to derive from the shared spacer token and aligned secondary color token with Bootstrap’s secondary palette for better theming.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (CSS-only changes).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Guarded against visual regressions by matching new token defaults to the pre-existing styling in each theme.

## Decisions - why
- Introduced component tokens to centralize styling knobs for cards, page spacing, and dashboard tiles so themes can adjust via variables instead of selector overrides.
- Converted fixed values (drop area radius/color, secondary badge color, multi-value field height) to variables to make future theme work easier while keeping current visuals.
- Removed duplicated .fw-card rules from theme styles in favor of token overrides to reduce maintenance and ensure consistency.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer CSS custom properties for theme variations; override variables per theme instead of repeating selector blocks.
- When replacing fixed sizes with tokens, set defaults to existing computed values to avoid visual drift.
