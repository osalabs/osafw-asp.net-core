## What changed
- Removed legacy page-header float overrides and refreshed header action partials (Vue and non-Vue) to align with the page header layout without compatibility CSS.
- Updated Vue header buttons to use real buttons, separating add/edit controls to mirror classic headers and to respect read-only states.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- N/A (dotnet CLI not available in the container).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet test` could not run because the `dotnet` command is missing in the environment.

## Decisions - why
- Added `mb-0` and flex utilities to header button partials to remove reliance on page-header-specific overrides.
- Swapped Vue action anchors for buttons so `:disabled` properly omits the attribute and blocks clicks when `fwStore.is_readonly` is true.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Binding `:disabled` to anchors in Vue leaves `disabled=\"false\"`; use `<button>` for boolean disabled state.
