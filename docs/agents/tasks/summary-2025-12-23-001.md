## What changed
- Restored legacy `toHashtable`/`toArrayList` conversion helpers to keep existing API surface while promoting `FwDict`/`FwList`.
- Simplified DevManage entity sorting comment and LINQ usage now that `FwList` already contains `FwDict` entries.
- Generalized deep-clone helper to handle any `IList`, exposing it as `cloneListDeep` for reuse.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `dotnet --version` (fails: CLI not available in container)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Legacy conversion helpers were removed previously; reintroduced them with `[Obsolete]` to preserve compatibility while steering new code to `FwDict`/`FwList`.
- Added `IList` deep-clone handling to avoid shallow copies when callers pass non-`FwList` collections.

## Decisions - why
- Keep obsolete aliases available to callers that still rely on Hashtable/ArrayList naming, avoiding breaking changes.
- Expose the list deep-clone helper to encourage consistent cloning behavior across collection types.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Maintain obsolete shims until confirmed safe to drop; prefer generic interfaces (e.g., `IList`) when widening helper support.
