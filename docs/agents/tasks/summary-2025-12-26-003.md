## What changed
- Added a shared `.fw-empty-state` style and applied it across attachments, subtables, and list templates to render clearer empty-state placeholders on view, edit, and list screens.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- None (dotnet CLI unavailable in container)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet test` failed because the `dotnet` CLI is not installed in the environment.

## Decisions - why
- Centralized empty-state styling ensures consistent UX for missing attachments and subtables without per-screen duplication.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Use `display_none` helpers or `unless` blocks to gate empty-state placeholders in ParsePage templates.
