## What changed
- Added template parsing and caching coverage to `FwSelfTest.configuration` so the self-test exercises templating and both cache layers.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `/root/dotnet/dotnet build`

## Pitfalls - fixes
- `dotnet test` ran for ~10 minutes without completing and was cancelled; rely on the faster build to validate the change.

## Decisions - why
- Exercising the template parser and caches in self-test gives quick feedback on two core subsystems without needing to run the full site.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Use `ParsePage.parse_string` with a tiny template to confirm parser wiring without file dependencies.
- Generate unique cache keys per test run and clean them up to avoid collisions.
