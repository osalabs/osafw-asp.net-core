## What changed
- Added comprehensive unit coverage for fw Utils-related helpers (Utils, FormUtils, UploadUtils, DateUtils) and new ImageUtils test suite.
- Fixed Utils.sendFileToUrl to keep file streams alive during multipart upload and added guards for System.Drawing tests on non-Windows.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- /root/dotnet/dotnet test /p:LibraryRestore=false

## Pitfalls - fixes
- System.Drawing is unavailable in this Linux container; ImageUtils tests are marked inconclusive when unsupported.
- HttpListener-based tests require unique free ports; helper picks ephemeral loopback ports.
- uploadSimple throws InvalidOperationException without a preset FormCollection; set an empty form when expecting missing uploads.

## Decisions - why
- Used HttpListener to exercise loadUrl/sendFileToUrl without external network dependencies.
- Normalized UploadUtils expectations by ensuring ROOT_URL is provided via FwConfig settings for URL-based helpers.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Guard image tests on non-Windows to avoid gdiplus issues.
- Provide request.Form explicitly when testing upload flows with empty payloads.
- Use IList-safe assertions when clone helpers may return base collection types.
