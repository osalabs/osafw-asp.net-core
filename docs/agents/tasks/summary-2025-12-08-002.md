## What changed
- Adjusted schema cache population, cookie helpers, and dynamic controller field handling to use safer string conversions.
- Added generator support for emitting default initializers (e.g., empty strings) in Row classes based on schema nullability.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- /root/dotnet/dotnet build /p:LibraryRestore=false

## Pitfalls - fixes
- LibMan restore fails to reach unpkg/jsdelivr providers; building requires `LibraryRestore=false` for now.

## Decisions - why
- Added empty-string defaults where database text fields should never be null and normalized hash lookups to skip missing names.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer `.toStr()`/coalescing before using hash values to avoid nullable warnings.
