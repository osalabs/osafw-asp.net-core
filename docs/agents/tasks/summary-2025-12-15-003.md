## What changed
- Added framework core tests for configuration overrides/route prefix regex building, logger dump/rotation and level filtering, and predefined framework exceptions.
- Adjusted ParsePage radio/include path expectations to match current template resolution rules.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- /root/dotnet/dotnet test /p:LibraryRestore=false

## Pitfalls - fixes
- ParsePage relative include expectations needed to align with tag_tplpath resolving to the caller directory rather than a nested folder.
- FwConfig AsyncLocal settings can leak across tests; cloning the existing settings before modification avoids breaking unrelated ParsePage cases.
- Logger rotation runs again on dispose when the size threshold is too small; seeding a larger test fixture file keeps post-write files available for assertions.

## Decisions - why
- Focused on coverage for lightweight core components (FwConfig, FwLogger, FwExceptions) this round while keeping tests isolated from shared static state.
- Matched ParsePage tests to the implemented path rules to validate real behavior instead of enforcing incorrect expectations.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Clone and restore AsyncLocal-backed settings when testing global configuration helpers.
- When exercising log rotation, seed oversized files but keep the size limit above expected write output to avoid second-rotation surprises in Dispose.
- Build temporary template trees that mirror the parser’s relative path resolution instead of assuming subfolder defaults.
