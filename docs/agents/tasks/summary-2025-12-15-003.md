## What changed
- Implemented missing fw tests covering CSV export utilities, temporary file cleanup, comma-string parsing, and ImportSpreadsheet fallback behavior.
- Added ParsePage coverage for filesystem templates, include resolution, language mapping defaults, radio option rendering, and aligned expectations with current relative path handling.
- Expanded framework core tests for configuration overrides/route prefix regex building, logger dump/rotation and level filtering, predefined framework exceptions, collection wrappers (FwDict/FwList) conversions, upload helper path/URL utilities, DB operation helpers/splitting, and route defaults/population.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- /root/dotnet/dotnet test /p:LibraryRestore=false

## Pitfalls - fixes
- ImportSpreadsheet requires ExcelDataReader; validated the NotSupported fallback instead of attempting to load external dependencies.
- ParsePage relative include expectations needed to align with tag_tplpath resolving to the caller directory rather than a nested folder.
- FwConfig AsyncLocal settings can leak across tests; cloning the existing settings before modification avoids breaking unrelated ParsePage cases.
- Logger rotation runs again on dispose when the size threshold is too small; seeding a larger test fixture file keeps post-write files available for assertions.

## Decisions - why
- Focused on manageable fw core areas (ParsePage, Utils, FwConfig, FwLogger, FwExceptions, FwCollections) while leaving heavier ConvUtils/DB coverage for later.
- Validated tests against current engine behavior instead of enforcing assumptions that diverge from implemented path/rotation logic.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer temporary directories/files for IO-heavy ParsePage and Utils tests to avoid polluting repo assets.
- When optional dependencies are absent, assert documented fallback behavior instead of forcing installation.
- Clone and restore AsyncLocal-backed settings when testing global configuration helpers.
- When exercising log rotation, seed oversized files but keep the size limit above expected write output to avoid second-rotation surprises in Dispose.
- Build template fixtures that mirror the parser’s relative path resolution instead of assuming subfolder defaults.
