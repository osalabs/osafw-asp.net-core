## What changed
- Applied `DBNameAttribute` mapping when building readable member dictionary so member name lookups respect DB aliases for properties and fields.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- [ ] dotnet test (dotnet SDK not available in container)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- dotnet CLI is not installed in the environment, so automated tests could not be executed.

## Decisions - why
- Matched readable member mapping to writable mapping to keep DBName-based round-tripping consistent.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Mirror attribute-based name translation between read/write paths to avoid mismatch bugs.
