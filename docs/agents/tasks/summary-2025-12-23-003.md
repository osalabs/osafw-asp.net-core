## What changed
- Implemented default theme polish: refreshed typography, card framing, table spacing, and bulk-action/pagination styling.
- Improved form spacing and helper text rhythm while keeping right-aligned labels on wide screens.
- Added responsive guardrails for multi-value fields and attachment thumbnails.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (CSS-only changes).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- None encountered; changes limited to CSS and documentation updates.

## Decisions - why
- Increased base font sizing and added shadows/padding to align the default theme with modern dashboard expectations.
- Kept right-aligned labels per review feedback while adding vertical gaps to reduce density.
- Added responsive max-heights and flex gaps so multi-value and attachment areas remain scannable on narrow screens.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Use shared CSS vars for padding/shadows so optional themes can override without rewriting components.
