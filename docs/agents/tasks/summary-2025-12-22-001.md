## What changed
- Updated framework docs and samples to reference `FwDict`/`FwList` instead of legacy Hashtable/ArrayList types.
- Renamed session dictionary helpers and removed obsolete DB list/dict aliases that still carried ArrayList/Hashtable terminology.
- Adjusted tests and comments to use generic collections while keeping legacy interoperability coverage.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `dotnet test` (fails: `dotnet` CLI not available in container)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Removed unused obsolete aliases rather than keeping dead references to legacy collection names.
- Ensured AGENTS instructions were mirrored to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` after updating terminology.

## Decisions - why
- Prefer explicit `FwDict`/`FwList` naming to avoid confusion around supported collection types.
- Kept Hashtable conversion tests because external interop remains part of the public API.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Favor generic `List`/`Dictionary` or `FwList`/`FwDict` over legacy `ArrayList`/`Hashtable` in examples and helpers.
