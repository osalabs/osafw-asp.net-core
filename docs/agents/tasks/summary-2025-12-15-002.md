## What changed
- Implemented several previously skipped fw tests covering CSV export utilities, temporary file cleanup, and template parsing behaviors.
- Added ParsePage coverage for disk-based templates, include resolution, language mapping defaults, and radio option rendering.
- Expanded Utils tests for CSV serialization, file helpers, and comma-string parsing while keeping ImportSpreadsheet behavior verified under the current build configuration.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- /root/dotnet/dotnet test /p:LibraryRestore=false

## Pitfalls - fixes
- ImportSpreadsheet requires ExcelDataReader; validated the NotSupported fallback instead of attempting to load external dependencies.
- ParsePage radio handling depends on .sel files; created temporary template directories to exercise include resolution without touching app assets.

## Decisions - why
- Focused on implementing manageable missing tests (ParsePage, Utils) within session scope while leaving ConvUtils Playwright/PDF paths for a future pass.
- Adjusted assertions to avoid MSTest analyzer errors and maintain compatibility with the existing test framework version.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer temporary directories/files for ParsePage and Utils IO-heavy tests to avoid polluting repo assets.
- When optional dependencies are absent, assert the documented fallback behavior instead of forcing installation.
