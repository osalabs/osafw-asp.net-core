## What changed
- Updated tests to use current FwConfig API and modern MSTest assertions, removing analyzer warnings.
- Added null-safety checks in tests and suppressed platform-specific System.Drawing warnings.
- Ensured image and upload utilities tests handle settings consistently across frameworks.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- /root/dotnet/dotnet test /p:LibraryRestore=false

## Pitfalls - fixes
- libman restore fails by default; use /p:LibraryRestore=false to skip.
- Nullability analyzers flag casts; added explicit checks and typed variables to satisfy warnings.

## Decisions - why
- Chose to update tests to new FwConfig accessors rather than adding obsolete aliases.
- Used MSTest analyzer recommendations (HasCount, IsEmpty, etc.) to silence build messages while improving clarity.
- Suppressed CA1416/SYSLIB0050 in ImageUtilsTests because System.Drawing remains Windows-only but tests guard for platform.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer Assert helpers over raw IsTrue/AreEqual when analyzers suggest specific methods.
- Use explicit casts with guard clauses to satisfy nullable analysis in tests.
