## What changed
- Moved class-only template partials into `App_Data/template/common/cl/`, renamed class files to match class names, and updated template references.
- Moved attribute-related template partials into `App_Data/template/common/attr/` and updated template references.
- Added a changelog entry documenting the template path changes and updated ParsePage documentation for the new class/attribute partial locations.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- Not run (not requested).

## Pitfalls - fixes
- None.

## Decisions - why
- Kept attribute-style partials separate from class partials to clarify usage and reduce template root clutter.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- When reorganizing template partials, update documentation and changelog to aid upgrades.
