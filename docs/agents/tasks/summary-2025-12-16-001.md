## What changed
- Added ConvUtils tests covering PDF/XLS guards, Excel export, and helper calculations.
- Implemented percentChange coverage plus new tests for cron schedule calculation and FwLogTypes constants.
- Expanded FW formatUserDateTime coverage for custom formats and cleaned up remaining TODO markers in FormUtils/Utils tests.
- Added FW user session coverage and FwEntities idByIcodeOrAdd logic with a fake model to avoid DB.
- Covered DB helpers including left trimming/length handling and provider-specific quoting/limit syntax.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- /root/dotnet/dotnet test osafw-tests/osafw-tests.csproj /p:LibraryRestore=false

## Pitfalls - fixes
- FW requires a configured session during tests; supplying a FakeSession avoided Session errors in ConvUtilsTests.

## Decisions - why
- Used reflection to validate private ConvUtils and FwCron helpers without invoking Playwright or cron jobs.
- Wrote exportNativeExcel tests against a file target to bypass response piping.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- When constructing FW in tests, inject a fake session to satisfy Session access.
- Reflection is a lightweight way to exercise private helpers tied to heavier runtime services.
