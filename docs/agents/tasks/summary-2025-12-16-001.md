## What changed
- Added comprehensive unit tests covering additional fw core controllers, utilities, and helpers.
- Introduced test stubs and virtual hooks to enable isolation of cron service, activity logs, controller routing, and key persistence behavior.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- /root/dotnet/dotnet build /p:LibraryRestore=false
- /root/dotnet/dotnet test /p:LibraryRestore=false

## Pitfalls - fixes
- Needed stub models and virtualized DB methods to test components without a live database.

## Decisions - why
- Opted to make select DB and service methods virtual to allow in-memory test doubles instead of relying on unavailable SQL Server instances.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer in-memory stubs with reflection helpers to avoid external dependencies in unit tests.
