## What changed
- Implemented new CRUD page header and autosave status for Admin/DemosDynamic list/view/edit.
- Added form sections + optional on-this-page nav driven by config, plus prose/empty-state improvements for view.
- Refreshed layout tokens, brand component, sidebar section titles, theme variable overrides, and documented layout/tokens.

## Commands that worked (build/test/run)
- `dotnet test` (fails: dotnet SDK not available in container)

## Pitfalls - fixes
- dotnet CLI not installed in the container; unable to run automated tests.

## Decisions - why
- Kept autosave status centralized in `fw.autosave.setStatus` to avoid scattered DOM updates.
- Used new page header/actions partials to limit impact to DemosDynamic while introducing shared structure.
- Introduced token-driven CSS to let themes override variables instead of duplicating rules.

## Heuristics (keep terse)
- Prefer section `section` key or explicit structural entries per section to keep layouts intact when grouping fields.
